## Introduction
Localization deals with the creation of both a global and local map
based on camera inputs so that the car can understand how its moving
and its surroundings. 

## Overview of the Problem
By being fed in raw data from the IMU, depth estimation, and cone
segmentation, the project must identify where cones are and create a
global map overtime by processing raw data and estimating where cones
are even if the data is noisy.

## Steps in the project
1. Literature review and PDR
1. Communication and finalization of input and output data formats 
1. Code base developed in a virtual test bench
1. Code review

## Suggested direction
