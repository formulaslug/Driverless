1. Finished by end of winter quarter

## Introduction
The project focuses on identifying a path from the map data by
using the cones to find the optimal path to move through the cones.

## Overview of the Problem
When raw map data is presented it'll be done in the form of a
coordinate system on a 2D plane. To generate a path to plan a route
through, a polygon and direction representation of the path must be identified.

## Steps in the project
1. Literature review
1. PDR
1. Triangulation methods
1. Data format standardization

## Suggested direction
- Unknown
