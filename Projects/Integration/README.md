In this folder for all prrojects, create a markdown file with the things you need from other projects. Specify very clearly what you will input and what you will output, including datatypes and expected formatting for the outputs. 
For example, if you were expecting an 800x342 np.array with a float32 datatype, specify that and what team you expect to get it from.
