## Introduction
Control input planning is a vehicle dynamics problem to generate the
optimal set of vehicle dynamics inputs needed to follow a
predetermined path. Other projects, such as path planning will already
generate a path that must be followed. 

## Overview of the Problem
Using and working with the VD and Simulations team, there will be a
program that exists that can use 3 degrees of freedom (brake,
throttle, steering) to estimate the change of position over the next
given amount of time. Using this simulation and a given path, you must
identify what inputs are required to follow the given path. 

## Steps in the project
1. Understand the file format for the given path
1. Understand the capabilities of the vehicle dynamics simulations
1. Literature review over methods to follow a line
1. Design of a control loop
1. Implementation of input selecting for a short period of time
1. Optimization
